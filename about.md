This website is made by [Jules Schoonman](https://www.sammeltassen.nl).

All images of _Berlin und seine Umgebungen im neunzehnten Jahrhundert_ originate from the edition held by the map room of the Berlin State Library. Full credit line: _Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin - Preu√üischer Kulturbesitz, Kartenabteilung. Inv. Nr. Kart. Y 44237_. Scans were cropped, desaturated and the contrast of the images was increased.

The (currently still incomplete) text was taken from the Google Books edition, which (apparently) can no longer be accessed. A PDF is available for download [here](/assets/pdf/Berlin_und_seine_Umgebeung_im_neunzehnte.pdf). Another digital edition is available on the website of the [Zentral- und Landesbibliothek Berlin](https://digital.zlb.de/viewer/image/15818591/76/)

Help with adding additional texts is more than welcome, the source files of the individual pages can be found [here](https://github.com/sammeltassen/spikers-berlin/tree/master/_posts). Please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="Contact">contact me</a> if you would like to contribute.

The website was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Barber](http://barber.samesies.io). It is deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). For the conversion from CSV to separate Markdown files, [wax_tasks](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_tasks) was used, made by [Minicomp](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/).
