This website was initiated and is maintained by <a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="Contact">Jules Schoonman</a>.

All images of _Berlin und seine Umgebungen im neunzehnten Jahrhundert_ originate from the edition held by the map room of the Berlin State Library. Full credit line: _Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin - Preu√üischer Kulturbesitz, Kartenabteilung. Inv. Nr. Kart. Y 44237_.

The scans were cropped, desaturated and the contrast of the images was increased.

The (currently still incomplete) text was taken from the Google Books edition, which (apparently) can no longer be accessed. A PDF is available for download [here](/assets/pdf/Berlin_und_seine_Umgebeung_im_neunzehnte.pdf).

Help with adding additional texts is more than welcome, the source files of the individual pages can be found [here](https://github.com/sammeltassen/spikers-berlin/tree/master/_posts). Please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="Contact">contact Jules</a> if you would like to contribute.

The website was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Barber](http://barber.samesies.io). It is deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). The source repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sammeltassen/spikers-berlin).
